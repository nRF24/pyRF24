"""
Simple example of using the RF24 class to transmit and respond with
acknowledgment (ACK) transmissions. Notice that the auto-ack feature is
enabled, but this example doesn't use automatic ACK payloads because automatic
ACK payloads' data will always be outdated by 1 transmission. Instead, this
example uses a call and response paradigm.
