"""This module uses the `RF24` class to make the nRF24L01 imitate a
Bluetooth-Low-Emissions (BLE) beacon. A BLE beacon can send data (referred to as
advertisements) to any BLE compatible device (ie smart devices with Bluetooth
4.0 or later) that is listening.

Original research was done by `Dmitry Grinberg and his write-up (including C
source code) can be found here
<http://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=11.%20Bluetooth%20LE%20fakery>`_
As this technique can prove invaluable in certain project designs, the code
here has been adapted to work with Python.

.. important:: Because the nRF24L01 wasn't designed for BLE advertising, it
    has some limitations that helps to be aware of.

    1. The maximum payload length is shortened to **18** bytes (when not
       broadcasting a device
       :py:attr:`~pyrf24.fake_ble.FakeBLE.name` nor
       the nRF24L01
       :py:attr:`~pyrf24.fake_ble.FakeBLE.show_pa_level`).
       This is calculated as:

       **32** (nRF24L01 maximum) - **6** (MAC address) - **5** (required
       flags) - **3** (CRC checksum) = **18**

       Use the helper function
       :py:func:`~pyrf24.fake_ble.FakeBLE.len_available()` to
       determine if your payload can be transmit.
    2. the channels that BLE use are limited to the following three: 2.402
       GHz, 2.426 GHz, and 2.480 GHz. We have provided a tuple of these
       specific channels for convenience (See `BLE_FREQ` and
       :py:func:`~pyrf24.fake_ble.FakeBLE.hop_channel()`).
    3. :py:attr:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.crc_length` is disabled in the
       nRF24L01 firmware because BLE  specifications require 3 bytes
       (:py:func:`~pyrf24.fake_ble.crc24_ble()`), and the
       nRF24L01 firmware can only handle a maximum of 2.
       Thus, we have appended the required 3 bytes of CRC24 into the payload.
    4. :py:attr:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.address_width` of BLE
       packet only uses 4 bytes, so we have set that accordingly.
    5. The auto-ack (automatic acknowledgment) feature of the nRF24L01 is useless
       when transmitting to BLE devices, thus it is disabled as well as automatic
       re-transmit (:py:meth:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.get_arc()`) and custom ACK
       payloads (:py:attr:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.ack_payloads`) features
       which both depend on the automatic acknowledgments feature.
    6. The :py:attr:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.dynamic_payloads`
       feature of the nRF24L01 isn't compatible with BLE specifications. Thus,
       we have disabled it.
    7. BLE specifications only allow using 1 Mbps RF
       :py:attr:`~pyrf24.rf24.RF24.data_rate`, so that too has
       been hard coded.
    8. Only the "on data sent" & "on data ready" events will have
       an effect on the interrupt (IRQ) pin. The "on data fail"  is never
       triggered because auto-ack feature is disabled. Keep this in mind when using
       `mask_irq()`.
